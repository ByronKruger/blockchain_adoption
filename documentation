Dependencies for basic DApp not fully decentralized(no React.js framework or IPFS):
1. **Node page manager** 
	* (mk)
	* download @ https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.15.1/node-v10.15.1-linux-x64.tar.xz
2. **Truffle framework**
	* Truffle framework allows us to create the DApp on the Ethereum blockchain by providing tools to write contracts, test contracts and deploy contracts
	* run `npm install -g truffle`
3. **Ganache**
	* Ganache is a private blockchain that runs locally for testing
	* download @ https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache/releases/download/v1.3.0/ganache-1.3.0-x86_64.AppImage
4. **MetaMask**
	* MetaMask extension is used to connect to the Ethereum blockchain and to interact with smart contracts
	* Download from the Google Chrome store
	* Note: MetaMask requires you to need to download the extension in order to use the DApp. This is not good for adoption. Fortmatic makes adopting DApp usage much simpler, wallets are created and transactions are signed using the user's phone numbers 
	* installing Fortmatic(mk)

Dependencies for fully decentralized modern DApp (using React.js and IPFS)

* clone the DApp from this repository.
* cd into the repository directory: run `cd <repo_name>.`.
* install all dependencies: run `npm install` (installs all dependencies specified in package.json)
* run the React app: run `npm start` (starts and host server locally)
* install Ganache (private blockchain run locally on which we deploy our contract) (not necessary if we are using the better tool - Fortmatic which requires more manual contract deployment)
*
